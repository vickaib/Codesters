# Codesters
Codesters is an educational platform designed to teach coding to K-12 students. It offers a block-based coding interface for beginners and introduces Python programming. 
I've created several lesson plans and game designs using its custom libraries, which you can view in their free Project page.

## Instructions to View:
- Visit https://www.codesters.com/project/ to view the platform.
- Copy code from individual project files in repository.
- Paste the code into the text editor and click the green 'Play' button to see the project run.

## Future Goals:
- Translate Codesters projects into the Pygame module.
- Create custom sprites, styles, and interfaces to make projects feel like complete games.
